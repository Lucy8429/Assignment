<h2 style="color: white;">Air Superiority</h2>
<div class="a">
  In the air superiority mission the Eurofighter Typhoon will typically be equipped with air-to-air missiles for the BVR and short range combat.
   It is the combination of thrust, maneuverability, modern sensors and data fusion that makes the Eurofighter Typhoon the superior air warfare platform.
</div><br><br>
<h2 style="color: white;">Air Interdiction</h2>
<div class="a">
    In this role the Eurofighter Typhoon is configured for ground attacks and even though
     it is equipped with a targeting pod and up to 7 ground attack weapons, it carries still 3 BVR and 2
     SR missiles.
</div><br><br>
<h2 style="color: white;">Close Air Support</h2>
<div class="a">
  The recent integration contract for the Brimstone has strengthened the CAS capabilities of the Eurofighter Typhoon since it
  can now engage in combat with a reduced risk of collateral damages of non-combatant or friendly forces.
</div>
<br><br>
<h2 style="color: white;">Swing Role</h2>
<div class="a">
  The Eurofighter Typhoon can simply switch from air-to-air into the air-to-ground role and back within the same mission. Multiple configurations of air-to-air and ground attack payloads can be
   put under 13 wing and fuselage stations which enables a highly flexible and mission specific configuration.
